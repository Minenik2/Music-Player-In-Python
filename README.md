## How to use
create a folder named 'music' (case sensetive) and put all the .wav files you want, run the program using 'sangtester.py', the program runs true the music folder finds any .wav files and represents them in the program, you can then choose what song to play and it will play. If you have folders inside the music folder no worries the program will searc true them aswell and save any .wav files so you can play them in the program.

This works with only .wav files, simpleaudio does not support .mp3, .flac or any other file format.
